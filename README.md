## why 

Yes I'm a fan of the Halo franchise

I'm just tired to convince friends to code with me in C projects because I'm not using the "right" tool ( aka Cmake )

I personaly prefer to right script and dealing with the compiler. 

So I'm trying to build a tool to concile both approach.

It's under heavely development

Yes It will crosscompile code using llvm etc ... bla bla bla lot of works
